Language isn’t fixed. Neither is this dictionary.

Dark mode is the default design choice of this project for a calm, eye-friendly experience.

## About the Project

Traditional dictionaries are fixed and slow to change. Language, however, is fast, cultural, emotional, and constantly evolving.

The Living Dictionary exists to reflect how people actually use words in real life, across cultures, regions, generations, and moments in time.

This is not just a reference tool.  
It is a living record of human expression.

It is built for:

• Real-life meanings  
• Cultural and emotional context  
• Modern usage  
• Emerging words  
• Evolving ideas  

This dictionary grows as people grow.

## Final Note

The Living Dictionary is more than a project.

It is a belief.  
That language is alive.  
That meaning is human.  
That words matter.  

And this is a place where they are allowed to live, grow, and evolve.
