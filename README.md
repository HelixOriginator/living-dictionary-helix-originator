## About the Project

**The Living Dictionary** is a new kind of dictionary. Traditional dictionaries are fixed, edited slowly, and often miss how real people actually use words in daily life. Language, however, changes every day — through culture, emotion, technology, regional influence, and time.

This project was created to reflect that living nature of language.

Instead of being static, this dictionary is **alive**:
- Meanings can evolve
- New words can be introduced
- Cultural and emotional context matters
- Real-world usage is central

It is a digital, open, and evolving language space for students, writers, researchers, thinkers, and the naturally curious.

This is not just a dictionary.  
It is a **living record of human expression**.
