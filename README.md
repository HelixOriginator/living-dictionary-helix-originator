## About the Project  

**The Living Dictionary** is not just another static dictionary. It’s a dynamic, evolving lexicon — a “living” reference that grows with language, reflects cultural context, and adapts as usage changes.  

- **Why “living”?** Because definitions can update in real-time. New meanings, regional usage, slang, cultural terms — all can be added and evolve over time.  
- **Problem solved:** Traditional dictionaries often lag behind — they can't keep up with how fast language evolves, or with the many regional, cultural, and context-dependent meanings of words. This project bridges that gap.  
- **What makes it unique:**  
   - Community-driven: Users can contribute new entries, suggest edits, add context.  
   - Context-aware: Words are explained not just by dictionary definitions, but with cultural background, usage examples, media (images/audio), and evolving meanings.  
   - Always up to date: As language changes — coined words, slang, new usages — the dictionary evolves.  
   - Accessible: Free, web-based, mobile-friendly — built for everyone.
